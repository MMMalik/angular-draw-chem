            Export your structure as <code>svg</code> by clicking 'transfer' (Actions/transfer) or <code>ctrl + t</code>
            (note: this shortcut is not working under Chrome, since Chrome's default binding for <code>ctrl + t</code> (tab opening) cannot be overriden).
            Close the editor to see that the result is shown on the webpage.

        <ul>
          <li>Choose a bond from <code>quick menu</code> or from <code>Structures</code>. 'Single', 'double', 'triple', 'wedge', 'dash' and 'undefined' bonds are available.</li>

            Alternatively, keep left mouse button pushed on the <code>drawing area</code> and move cursor around to see where new bond will appear.
            If you keep <code>ctrl</code> key pressed while moving the cursor, a bond of custom length will be formed.

          <li>
            You may change the bond type at any time by choosing a new bond and clicking on the existing bond. E.g. if you want to change 'single' bond to 'wedge',
            just choose 'wedge' bond and click on a 'single' bond. 'Double' bond comes in three variations: centered, pushed to left, and pushed to right. To change between them,
            choose 'double' bond and click multiple times on a bond. You may quickly change multiplicity of a bond, by clicking on it (with 'single' bond chosen).
            E.g. draw a 'single' bond, click on it again and it will change to 'double', and again to make it a 'triple' bond. Click again to return to a 'single' bond.
            'Wedge' and 'dash' bonds have two modes: normal and inverted. E.g. choose a 'dash' bond, draw it, then click on it once again.

          <li>Choose a cyclic structure from <code>quick menu</code> or from <code>Structures</code>. Currently, structures from three- to nine-membered rings are available.</li>

            Rules for drawing are similiar to those already described for bonds. Choose a structure, then draw it on the <code>drawing area</code>.
            You may keep left mouse button pushed on the <code>drawing area</code> and move cursor around to see where the cyclic structure will appear (the rotation is by 15 degrees).
            If you keep <code>ctrl</code> key pressed while moving the cursor, the structure will be rotated by custom angle.
            Currently, drawing of fused rings is not well-supported, but it will be soon :-).
